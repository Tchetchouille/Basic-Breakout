This is a prototype of a breakout game made on my free time to experiment with Unity.
The twist is that it is circular; the player moves the bar around bricks that spawn in the middle of the screen and slowly move towards the edges. 
This adds a sense of urgency to the gameplay. it also means that instead of multiple levels, there is one infinite and continuous succession of bricks.

It is unfinished, though it is technically playable. There is no executable as the game is not finished. 
It is unlikely that this project will ever get finished as I've since migrated to Godot for such projects.
